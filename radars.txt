Notes on Radars - Thales presentation

RADAR is an acronym for RAdio (transmission and reception of electromagnetic waves in the radio frequency range, less than 300 GHz)
Detection (detection of objects of interest in the environment, while being remote from them) And Ranging (measuring some properties, 
such as speed).

How do Radars work? (at least the ones constructed in Limours)
Pulses are generated and transmitted periodically to 'illuminate' the space (pulse radars). We define the pulse repetition period PRI 
the time between each transmitted pulse. However, some echoes of any type reach the radar and cause perturbations.

Low frequency --> Large wavelength --> Large antenna
Large frequency --> Low wavelength --> Low antenna

What is an antenna?
Device that ensures the transition of the waves between a guided environment and the air (when perfect antenna: no losses of energy).
The radar antenna is the visible part of the radar. For a given frequency, the greater the size of an antenn in a dimension, the more it is 
capable of focusing the wave in this direction.

Isotropic antenna: fictive antenna that sends energy in all directions related to the antenna's directivity.
